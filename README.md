 The neural network in this example is a feed-forward backpropagation network as this is one of the most commonly used, the network concept will be described briefly in the background section.
 An artificial neural network is a mathematical computing model which is designed to mimic the way in which the brain reacts to sensory inputs. The brain is made up of millions of neurons which are connected to each other in huge networks. Each neuron is capable of being stimulated, much like a switch being turned on or off, and the state of the neuron turns surrounding neurons on or off as well depending on the level of activation of the neuron and the strength of the connection between the neurons. A neuron with a strong connection will have a greater level of stimulation than one with a weaker connection.
